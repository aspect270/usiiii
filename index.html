    <p>Tell me darling now how the hell Did I let the time slip away so fast I've been drowning in troubled waters Trying to make a fleeting feeling last I know that the sun gonna rise in the morning
Bringing a brand new fear to my worried mind I don't need any sympathy I just wanna make things right with you and I 'cause You can't tell me no lies Girl I see through the smile you're faking
I just can't take it (No) And I'm well aware of it Niggas wanna be in love for the hell of it You're what they're chasing I have to face it
Girl, I've been up all night just Running it through my mind, yeah How could I be so blind lately?
Am I losing you baby?
Girl, I've been up all night just
Trying to make wrong things right
Feelings that I just can't hide lately
Am I losing you baby?
Seven-thirty, alone again
Baby girl you treat me just like a friend
I don't need an apology
Just to hide the truth under a lie again
I know that the feeling comes in a moment
Watching the whole thing crumble before my eyes
I don't need you to fight with me
I just wanna make things right with you and I 'cause You can't tell me no lies
Girl I see through the smile you're faking
I just can't take it
(Oh no)

Niggas wanna be in love for the hell of it
You're what they're chasing

Running it through my mind, yeah
How could I be so blind lately?
Am I losing you baby?
Girl, I've been up all night just
Trying to make wrong things right
Feelings that I just can't hide lately
Am I losing you baby? (Am I losing you baby?)
(Am I losing you baby?)
I'll take my time I'll do this right
(Am I losing you baby?)
I'll leave the lies inside my mind
(Am I losing you baby?)
Girl, I've been up all night just
Running it through my mind, yeah
How could I be so blind lately?
Am I losing you baby?
Girl, I've been up all night just
Trying to make wrong things right
Feelings that I just can't hide lately
Am I losing you baby?
How many hours must you wait
Acting like you a stranger
To my ways?
You don't need to ask me 'bout my day, yeah
I know what you came for
It's okay
Let me take you higher
Than any place you been
We can start a fire
You just tell me when
You just tell me when
And I'm at a loss of words to say
You as bright as the summertime
But you feel like the rain
And all of my time has slipped away
All I'm trying to do, babe
Is make your day
Let me take you higher
Than any place you been
We can start a fire
You just tell me when
Baby, you just tell me when
Baby, I swear
I will be there for you
Baby, I swear
I will be there for you
Baby, I swear
I will be there for you
Baby, I swear
I will be there for you
Baby, I swear
Baby, I swear
I will be there for you
Baby, I swear
I will be there for you
(Come in)
Girl, you're the river
Of healing
I was certain that I wouldn't last
And you are the answer
To questions
That I didn't know my soul was asking
My time's been wasted
Searching for light
When you're the brightest thing in my life
'Cause you're the water that runs forever
When I'm feeling like my well is running dry
And you're my center, you keep me tethered
Even when I drift away from time to time
Got me feeling like it's too good to be mine
Too good to be mine
I have been broken
And beaten
Yeah, the world knows how to break you down
But when pain blurs my vision
I won't worry
Because you always turn it back around
My time's been wasted
Searching for light
When you're the brightest thing in my life, yeah
'Cause you're the water that runs forever
When I'm feeling like my well is running dry
And you're my center, you keep me tethered
Even when I drift away from time to time
Got me feeling like it's too good to be mine
Too good to be mine, yeah
'Cause you're the water that runs forever
When I'm feeling like my well is running dry
And you're my center, you keep me tethered
Even when I drift away from time to time
Got me feeling like it's too good to be mine
Too good to be mine
Got me feeling like it's too good to be mine
Too good to be mine
Got me feeling like it's too good to be mine
Too good to be mine Guess I did see it coming
Made it look easy, we barely even had to try
Riding 'round town 'til the morning
Braving the breeze as we stare at passing satellites

You told me you would take aim
But it's not even an option
You fake everything
And now that it's all in the open
Everything's clear as daylight

Deep green
Running 'cross your surface like oceans
Of emotions
Deep green
I can read it all in the motion
Don't you make a sound

Clearly, you don't understand
Got your own reasons to drag it to the bitter end
Talking all night
'Cause you know where it's going
Setting the room on fire
Like you don't care
If it's unfair
And you never look back

You told me you would take aim
But it's not even an option
You change everyday
And now that's it's all in the open
Everything's clear as daylight

Deep green
Running 'cross your surface like oceans
Of emotions
Deep green
I can read it all in the motion
Don't you make a sound

Always deep green
Running cross your surface like oceans
Of emotions
Deep green
I can read it all in the motion
Know it's over now

Deep green
(Don't you make a sound)
Deep green
(Know it's over now)
Deep green
Would it make you feel better, babe
If I told you I've been feeling things you don't believe in?
Thinking that I'm seeing things
Your heart is in the ground and my head's through the ceiling
All the possibilities
Losing my ability to know what you're feeling (uh, uh, uh)
I've been wondering what you think about
Baby, you don't tell me, so I'm only assuming
You don't think I hear you out
But say you're happy, long as I'm giving the time that I'm due and
I could never leave you now
But if you feel like walking out, baby, then do it (uh, uh, uh)
Well the rain keeps pouring down
Trouble keeps on coming 'round
If you tell me you're over it
I'ma tell you I'm over it
If you're hiding what you feel
Underneath a bitter pill
If you tell me you're over it
I'ma tell you I'm over it
I've been searching for the point of it
Moments that we share together losing their meaning
Tell me what the matter is
Feeling like you're fighting me for no fucking reason
Baby, take a break from it
Space from all the petty shit should give you healing (uh, uh, uh), yeah
Well, the rain keeps pouring down
Trouble keeps on coming 'round
If you tell me you're over it
I'ma tell you I'm over it
If you're hiding what you feel
Underneath a bitter pill
If you tell me you're over it
I'ma tell you I'm over it
Baby, I'll take it slowly
The truths of your heart unfolding
I want you to rest in knowing
If you tell me you're over it
I'ma tell you I'm over it
Baby, I'll take it slowly
The truths of your heart unfolding
I want you to rest in knowing
If you tell me you're over it (you can tell me)
I'ma tell you I'm over it
Baby, I'll take it slowly
The truths of your heart unfolding
I want you to rest in knowing You've been living like a queen on such a small amount
Closing your eyes to all your desires
You've been living off the moments that I come around
Girl, I'm surprised your hope's still alive
Where there is truth, there is bound to be pain
People get older, but some things don't change
Given me more than my own heart can take
But I will remain, love
Hidden underneath the torment of our yesterdays
My mind is clear 'long as I'm here
And baby girl, I can't afford another breakaway
Hard as it feels year after year
Where there is truth, there is bound to be pain
People get older, but some things don't change
Given me more than my own heart can take
But I will remain, love
Time only makes it harder
But all of my days, I will remain
Time only makes it harder
But I won't complain, I will remain, love
Where there is truth, there is bound to be pain
People get over, but some things don't change
Given me more than my own heart can take
But I will remain, love I swear I thought it was over
'Til you came crashing into my brain
You come around needing closure
The pain and the passion remain the same
Feel like I touched the moon
Driving down the avenue
There ain't a thing I wouldn't do
To get you off my mind
Feel like I touched the moon
Tryna find me something new
There ain't a thing I wouldn't do
To get you off my mind
Just when I thought I could manage
To keep a balance, I'm on the ground
You've always had the advantage
Of being callous, no longer bound
Feel like I touched the moon
Driving down the avenue
There ain't a thing I wouldn't do
To get you off my mind
Feel like I touched the moon
Tryna find me something new
There ain't a thing I wouldn't do
To get you off my mind
Feel like I touched the moon
Driving down the avenue
There ain't a thing I wouldn't do
To get you off my mind
Feel like I touched the moon
Tryna find me something new
There ain't a thing I wouldn't do
To get you off my mind Faded paint on your Impala
Red is never gonna look the same
Even when the sky at end of day's
Lighting up your face like
Portraits hang in your apartment
Never have they looked at me that way
I can't help but wonder what they'd say
As they catch the daylight
But when you look in my eyes
The way you look in my eyes
It kills me every time
Driving 'round the city with my eyes closed
No phone, in the afterglow
It was you and me
But when you look in my eyes
The way you look in my eyes
It fills me with desire
Cause even when the sky is falling
You are all I want, I can't do anything
Talk your shit you've got your battles
With enemies who live inside your head
Hands are tied and eyes are burning red
Nothing left unsaid, no
But when you look in my eyes
The way you look in my eyes
It kills me every time
Driving 'round the city with my eyes closed
No phone, in the afterglow
It was you and me
But when you look in my eyes
The way you look in my eyes
It fills me with desire
Cause even when the sky is falling
You are all I want, I can't do anything
But when you look in my eyes
The way you look in my eyes
Fills me with a fire
Even when the sky is falling
You are all I want, I can't do anything Oh my, it's quite a life
When you'd run away from anything
Your plight is by design
Like you want someone to intervene

But every single night you come alive
You pay the price
You fall from sky heights
Oh my, it's quite a time
To be whole

In the slow fade
You can't evade
In the slow fade
I fear the same
As time takes the toll it's entitled
We're finally taking our place
In the slow fade
With no escape

Your dreams and pretty things
They don't shine like they used to shine
The valley's low
Fountain dry
All your life you've been out of time

But every single night you come alive
You bathe in light
You fall from sky heights
Oh my, it's quite time
To be whole

In the slow fade
You can't evade
In the slow fade
I fear the same
As time takes the toll it's entitled
We've no other choice but to change
In the slow fade
With no escape

As time takes the toll it's entitled
We never will be quite the same
In the slow fade
With no escape

In the slow fade Take me
I wanna go
Think that I forgot it
Tell me
I wanna know
Everything I'm not
Wasted time
I lied
But still you ride
(You ride, you ride)
Wasted time
All night
But still you ride
Make me
I wouldn't fold
Leave me where it started, yeah
Hate me
Heart made of stone
Ain't no qualms about it
Wasted time
I lied
But still you ride
(You ride, you ride)
Wasted time
All night
But still you ride
(You ride)
Running through your thoughts
Take another loss
No one knows
Running through your thoughts
Changing all the locks
Feels like home
Wasted time
I lied
But still you ride
(You ride, you ride)
Wasted time
All night
But still you ride
Running through your thoughts
Take another loss
Still you ride
(You ride, you ride)
Running through your thoughts
Take another loss
Still you ride
(You ride, you ride)
Maybe it's how your soul ran through me like blood in my veins
Maybe it's how your love would pull me through every day
You can throw away the picture frames
Just keep me in the back of your mind
You can feel the ways you need to, baby
I don't need a place in your life
I just wanna be in your head
(In your head, in your head)
Even if you don't love me
Even if you don't love me
And if you wanna call, just go 'head
(Just go 'head, just go 'head)
Even if you don't love me
Even if you don't love me
Baby, it's been so long, did you always call me by name?
Ever since you built walls, I crave all the things they contain
You can throw away the picture frames
Just keep me in the back of your mind (yeah, baby)
You can feel the ways you need to, baby
I don't need a place in your life
I just wanna be in your head
(In your head, in your head)
Even if you don't love me
Even if you don't love me
And if you wanna call just go 'head
(Just go 'head, just go 'head)
Even if you don't love me
Even if you are done with me
I just wanna be in your head
Your head, in your head
Even if you don't love me (even if you don't love)
Even if you don't love me
And if you wanna call, just go 'head
(Just go 'head, just go 'head)
Even if you don't love me
Even if you don't love me Could walk on water
Into the flame
Could make a battle out of anything
Thought you were stronger
You play the game
And run to the edge as you lose everything

(And ooh)
Living in your head
Til you die undecided
(And ooh)
Ain't nobody gonna save you now

You want somebody to change you
But there ain't no tears from a dove
No falling in love too fast
Thinking to much on your past
There's only two ways out
And one of them's out of your mind
Looking for a greener side of the blues

(And ooh, yeah)
Living in your head
Til you die undecided
(And ooh)
Ain't nobody gonna save you now

(And ooh)
You want it so badly the day turns to night (And yet ooh)
Ain't nobody gonna save you now

Kiss of the golden hour
Drawing your circles around what you want to say
Nothing will get you out
(Ain't nobody gonna save you now)

(And ooh)
Living in your head
Til you die undecided
(And ooh)
Ain't nobody gonna save you now It's so classic
One to one
We keep up the fight but never get enough
I don't tell you
How it feels
I just walk away assuming time will heal
Baby, oh
I just wanna make sense of it all
I can't take the silence when you're gone
I'd fall right back to you
All you'd have to do is just say so
Say so
Picking battles
Keeping score
I tried all the things I never would before
I know well that
Time won't bend
Watch it fade away as anger settles in
Baby, oh
I just wanna make sense of it all
I can't take the silence when you're gone
I'd fall right back to you
All you'd have to do is just say so
Say so
I know that I let you down
We could never turn back now
I don't wanna go
Changing on my own
I know that I let you down
You could never love me now
Baby, don't you go
Changing on your own
Baby, oh I could spend a lifetime and eternity
Tryna to get your love
I could give you the sky and everything in it
And it wouldn't be enough
I'd go on for life if your indifference
Didn't stop me in my tracks (no, no)
If you had a need and I could meet it
Nothing on Earth could ever keep it from your grasp
And maybe I'm foolish
Wasting time on games I'm only losing in
But I know you'd lose it
If I spent that time anywhere else
Baby, I can't wrap my head around it
You've been searching for a love
That you already found
And through all the things I do
I tell you every day
But everything I do for you
Is done in vain
Done in vain
You act like the sun would never rise again
If I let you go
You were never the one who wanted it different
And you're better on your own
But there are days I wish my love
Was good enough, baby
Good enough to
Make you think again
I've been giving you
All you ever needed
You gave me an endless list of reasons
Why I cannot be your man
And maybe I'm foolish
Wasting time on games I'm only losing in
But I know you'd lose it
If I spent that time anywhere else
Baby, I can't wrap my head around it
You've been searching for a love
That you already found
And through all the things I do
I tell you every day
But everything I do for you
Is done in vain
